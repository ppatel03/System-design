Tips :
- Ask functional requirements first (example, ability to post tweet, view tweet)
- Ask DAU. If MAU is provided, atleast ask % of daily users. 
- Ask user activity : example read vs write ratio, or number of writes (example, 2 tweets per day)
- Ask non-functional requirements 
  These are very important and can convert entire inteview in your favor. Example if latency is 1s, then you do not need complex caching architecture.
    -- Latency 
           this would help decide whether you really need low latency optimizations like cache, or not. 
           Remember today mosts have 1 Gbps network which has 10 us to transfer 1 KB
    -- Availability 
          this would help decide the redundancy and reliability - example mostly 99.99% a day means you can compromise 10s (10 ^ 5 * 10 ^ -4)
          of unavailability or being unrelible. With this you can even decide that, your system could be out of sync from third part servers for 10s in a
          day
    

QPS estimate
- 1 day ~ 10^5 s
- 1 month ~ 3 * 10 ^ 6s and further ~ 10 ^ 6s
- 1 week ~ 7 * 10 ^ 5s and further ~ 10 ^ 6s
----- For time constraints, do not hesitate to round off large amounts

Read : Write ratio


Distributed Systems estimate

Estimates in KB

Send 1 KB sequential from 1 Gbps network = 10 us  
Send 1 KB sequential from memory  = 0.25 us   (4 GB/s = 0.25 *  10 ^ -6 s) 
Send 1 KB sequential from disk    = 30 us     (30 MB/s = 0.03 * 10 ^ -3 s ) 
Send 1 KB sequential from cache   = 1 us    (1 GB/s = 1 * 10 ^ -6 s ) 

So network is 3 times faster than disk
memory is 40 times faster than network

Benchmarks on common systems

Cache

    Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Efficiency and Servicability/Manageability
    -> Remember an Avaiability system does not means Reliable but Reliable system is always available. 
    
    High level storage based on read : write ratio
      https://bytebytego.com/courses/system-design-interview/proximity-service
      If Read ratio is high than writes, remember to apply master/slave architecture for storage  replica for reads and master/primary for write 
    
    Sharding and Replicating 
      https://bytebytego.com/courses/system-design-interview/proximity-service
      These are two different concepts and usually you need both. Sharding is very common though.
      However, if your DB requirements are not huge (say 10 GB), you can simply create replicas to distribute read load than sharding it

- Load balancing
    Resources
      https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/load-balancing.md
      https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/types-of-load-balancing-algorithms/
      https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/load-balancing-system-design-interview
    Static load balancing - round robin, weight round robin, IP hash
    Dynamic load balanacing - least connection, least resource, least response time, least bandwidht
    When to use Static ?
      If the server pool and the requests are both homogeneous, and there is only one balancer
    When to use Dynamic ?
      if the requests are heterogenous, Least Load is helpful to prevent servers from being intermittently overloaded.
      
    What are Hardware load balancers ?
      They have high performant hardware resources like L4 and L7. 
      Read about L4 and L7 here https://levelup.gitconnected.com/l4-vs-l7-load-balancing-d2012e271f56
      
    What are Software load balancers ?
      They run on standard servers and are less hardware optimized, but cheaper to set up and run. Example, Nginx or HAProxy. For Nginx 100s video, 
      refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c. Nginx can serve routing to different servers, rate limiting, handle spikes,
      reverse proxy, security, cache, etc. 
      
    When to use Software or Hardware ?
      Tip : Since software load balancing can run on ordinary hardware and supports, always prefer software load balancer. Example Nginx
       
      
    What is proxy server, reverse proxy and API Gateway ? How is different from load balancer
      proxy vs reverse proxy vs load balancer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiqrArNSxSM
      Proxy : just protects the client side
      Reverse Proxy : protects the server by serving as proxy for all backend services - routing, rate limitng, load balancing
      API gateway : rate limiting, routing, handle spikes
      Load balancer : only performs load balancing
      
      So Reverse proxy can perform both API Gateway and Load Balancing. Example nginx.
      A load balancer can never be API gateway or reverse proxy.
      
     Always choose Nginx ? Why ?
       Has triats of load balancing + reverse proxy + API gateway
         - supports load balancing
         - supports reverse proxy 
         - supports rate limiting
         - supports caching
         - supports request grouping
         - supports secure auth
       Nginx supports L7

  - Caching
    Resources
      https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/caching.md
      Distributed cache on Application server VS Global cache like Redis, (mostly preferred)
      CDN is another form of cache for static content but its often expensive
      
          
       What are different caching strategies ? 
          https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/
          Cache-Aside (application server has cache aside like Redis, Memcache and DB separately)
            - Pros : logic controlled by application server, resilent to cache failures, data model in cache vs db could be different
            - Cons : stale data in cache for db writes
          Read-Through Cache (application server reads from cache only)
            - Pros : logic controlled by cache, read-heavy, good consistency when combined with write through 
            - Cons : needs data model to be consistent, first time data always results in cache miss

          Belpw are Cache writes invalidation policy 

          Write through (data is written to cache and synced with storage)
            - Pros : fast retreival and data consistent systems
            - Cons : slow writes though
          Write around (data is written to storage, not cache)
            - Pros : Saves write operation on the cache
            - Cons : recently written data creates a cache miss and higher latency.
          Write back (data is written to cache only, then synced later to storage)
            - Pros : fast retreival, low latency read / writes
            - Cons : Risk of data loss
            
        Real applications of 
          1. read-through, write-through for high consistency
                DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for dynamoDB
          2. read-through, write-around for high performance for situations where data is written once and read less frequently or never.
                real-time logs, chatroom messages
          3. cache-aside, write back cache to absorb spikes during peak load
                custom applications using redis
          4. write back cache
                InnoDB which is relational database storage engine. Queries are first written to memory and eventually flushed to the disk.

    - Indexing
        Resources
          https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/indexes.md
          What is a database index ? 
            https://www.codecademy.com/article/sql-indexes
          Pros
            helps in speeding up the search 
          Cons
            lowers write/update/delete performance
          When to use indexes ?
            In the case of data sets that are many terabytes in size but with very small payloads (e.g., 1 KB), 
            indexes are a necessity for optimizing data access. Finding a small payload in such a large dataset can be a real challenge since
            we can’t possibly iterate over that much data in any reasonable time. Furthermore, it is very likely that such a large data set is 
            spread over several physical devices—this means we need some way to find the correct physical location of the desired data. 
            Indexes are the best way to do this.
            
   ================================================================

     - Proxy 
        Resources
          https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/proxies.md
          
          Usage : 
          filter requests, log requests, cache, encryption and most important batch request. Further, it can get smarter to o collapse requests 
          for data that is spatially close together in the storage (consecutively on disk). This strategy will result in decreasing request latency. 
          For example, let’s say a bunch of servers request parts of file: part1, part2, part3, etc. We can set up our proxy in such a way 
          that it can recognize the spatial locality of the individual requests, thus collapsing them into a single request and reading complete file, 
          which will greatly minimize the reads from the data origin.
          
          Proxy are of two types 
          Client proxy to protect the clients
          Server proxy to protect the servers. Also called reverse proxy
          
          Should we use proxy then?
          Only use proxy to protect the client.
          For server side, Always Nginx since its open source and supports both reverse proxy + load balancing + API gateway.

          Queues
          
            Resource :
            - https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/queues.md
            
            When to use queue :
            Queues are implemented on the asynchronous communication protocol, meaning when a client submits a task to a queue they 
            are no longer required to wait for the results; instead, they need only acknowledgment that the request was properly received.
            
            Queues are also used for fault tolerance as they can provide some protection from service outages and failures. For example, 
            we can create a highly robust queue that can retry service requests that have failed due to transient system failures
            
            When not to use queue :
            When client expects respone in real-time
            
            Example of queues : 
             RabbitMQ and Kafka (which is open source)

        Redundancy and Replication
        
          Resource : 
          https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/redundancy.md
          
          When to use Redundant system :
          Always. its a key concept of distributed system.
          Always prefer shared nothing architecture so that each node can operate independently and can scale.

        SQL vs NoSQL
        
          Resource : 
          https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/sql-vs-nosql.md
          
          SQL 
          Relational databases store data in rows and columns. Example, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres
          
          NoSQL 
          Key-value :  Example, DynamoDB, Redis, Memcache
          Document DB : Example, MongoDB, 
          Wide-Column Database : Example, HBase, Cassandra - https://hevodata.com/learn/columnar-databases/
          Graph Databases : Example, Neo4j
          
          Differences between both 
          Storage : SQL is tables but NoSQL has different storage models
          Schema : changing schema with SQL is possible but requires whole database modification
          Querying : using SQL for SQL dbs. 
          Scalability : SQL is vertically scalable and possible to scale it horizontally but has limitations. NoSQL is horizontally scalable
          Reliability or ACID : Definitely SQL ensures ACID but NoSQL solutions sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.
          
          When to use SQL
            ACID compliance for e-commerce and finanicial transactions
            Your data is structured and unchanging.
            
          When to use NoSQL
            - Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no structure. 
            - Making the most of cloud computing and storage. Cloud-based storage is an excellent cost-saving solution 
            but requires data to be easily spread across multiple servers to scale up. 
            - Rapid development. NoSQL is extremely useful for rapid development as it doesn’t need to be prepped ahead of time. 
            
          What about write performance ? 
            I think SQL provides more flexibility on write performance than NoSQL.

    CAP Theorem
    Resource : 
    https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/cap-theorem.md
    
    CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed software system to simultaneously provide more than two out of three of 
    the following guarantees (CAP): Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.
    
    We can only build a system that has any two of these three properties. Because, to be consistent, all nodes should see the same set of updates 
    in the same order. But if the network suffers a partition, updates in one partition might not make it to the other partitions before a client 
    reads from the out-of-date partition after having read from the up-to-date one. The only thing that can be done to cope with this possibility 
    is to stop serving requests from the out-of-date partition, but then the service is no longer 100% available.

    When to choose consistency over availability ? 
      Banking, Payment systems
    
    When to choose consistency over availability ? 
      Most distributed system use cases like Google Maps, Twitter, etc.
      
    Since reliability consists of both consistency and availability, ASK YOUR interviewer what it means for system to be 99.99% reliable

    Consistent Hashing
    
    Resource 
      https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/consistent-hashing.md
      Recommended ones 
        https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/consistent-hashing-6524e48ac648 - Explains well about rebalancing
        https://bytebytego.com/courses/system-design-interview/design-consistent-hashing
        
      How does it work ? 
        Hashing is done in the range where it maps the key to the integer in that range. Example 0 -> 255 are the integers placed in ring form 
        such that values are wrapped around.
        
        1. the servers are mapped to the integers in that range
        2. to map key to a server, simply hash the key to the integer in that range and move clockwise till you find the server (could be binary search)
        
        Now how this is better :
        1. adding a server : say S1 is added at position 20 and is near S2 at position 25. Then keys from before 20 wuld map to S1.
        2. removing a server : say S1 is removed at position 20 and was near S2 at position 25. Then  all keys even before 20 would map to S2. 
        3. uniform distribution : add “virtual replicas”. Instead of mapping each server to a single point on the ring, 
            we map it to multiple points on the ring, i.e. replicas. 
        4. easy to rebalance : when server is added or removed, only its next clockwise neighbouring server is affected and requires re-mapping of keys.

    Client-Server Communication
    
      Resource : 
        https://github.com/Jeevan-kumar-Raj/Grokking-System-Design/blob/master/basics/client-server-communication.md
        
      Types : 
      1. Standard HTTP Web Request : client opens the connection, gets response from the server and terminate the connection 
      2. Ajax Polling : client performs HTTP Web Request above periodically (say every 1 s). May create unecessary empty responses if server is not ready.
      3. Long Polling : client performs HTTP Web Request and waits for long time till response is received (say 1 min). Then sends request again.
      4. Web Socket: persistent connection between a client and a server that both parties can use to start sending data at any time.
      5. SSE :  persistent onnection between a client and a server where server send data to the client but not the reverse
      
      When to use Long Polling vs Web Socket ? 
        https://ably.com/blog/websockets-vs-long-polling
        https://dev.to/kevburnsjr/websockets-vs-long-polling-3a0o
        
        Clearly Websockets have many advantages over long polling and thus are appropriate for many applications which require consistent low latency 
        full duplex high frequency communication such as chat applications and real time applications.
        
        Scaling up 
        Websockets have problems with load distribution due to persistent connection.
        Long polling will have equal load distribution after its long timeout
        
     When to use Web Socker vs Server Sent Events ?
        Websocket for bi-directional communication whole SSE for server to client communication
        https://blog.bitsrc.io/websockets-vs-server-sent-events-968659ab0870
        
        WebSockets are widely used and valued in technological solutions such as real-time polling, chat, media players, multiplayer games, etc.
        Server-Sent Events: There are many applications where sending data from the client isn’t necessary. 
        SSEs are especially useful in status updates, social-media news feeds, push notifications, newsletters, etc.
