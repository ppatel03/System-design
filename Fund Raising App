        Asymmetric encryption could be used here for payment gateway

          also used in HTTPS, SSH, Bitcoin, Emails using PGP protocol

        How HTTPS works ? How it uses SSL and TLS
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hExRDVZHhig
          HTTPS uses public key encryption to secure data using SSL (Secure socket layer) protocol. Basically server gives SSL certicate to client and acknowledgement is established between the two. Then info can be transferred securely using encryption.
          TLS is latest and successor of SSL
          Today most websites supports https because of google standards

            Moderm HTTPS uses TLS
            1. first establishes TCP handshake at transport 
            2. then client sends hello and gets the certificate from server which has public key of server (Asymmetric) 
            3. then client encryptes his/her session key with server's public key and then on server, it gets clients sesssion key by decrypting with server's private key. This is Asymmetric encryption
            4. Now both has session key and uses session key as cipher to encrypt and decrypt at both sides. This is Symmetric encryption.

            SSL uses public key encryption (Asymmetric encryption) only
